    In order to use the graphs and class diagram with GitHub you will need a browser extension. GitHub does not generate the mermaid markup for markdown on it's own. This step is not needed for GitLab. <br/>

The Documents Folder will hold both supportive development documents and the auto generated markdown files created by the Ovid Tools package and a few runners used to generate the Data Models Classes and diagrams. To learn more about the tools please visit the tools [README.md](https://github.com/Synoki-Labs/Ovid/tree/main/Ovid.Tools)
</p>
<p>
It is recommended that you place a README.MD in the root of your project, this should describe the developer responsible for the feature and contact information, a description of the feature, any dependencies from other Ovid components, and any integration information. 
</p>
<p>
A short description on how to run the project or the current development endpoint to access the feature is a helpful tip for anyone developing integration test.

The Documentation Root can be found at [/Documents](https://github.com/Synoki-Labs/Ovid/tree/main/Documents). The Generated folder is automatically generated by the Ovid Tools. Any assets used in Wiki and intended for finial documentation may reside here to be collated into a Help and Documentation section.
